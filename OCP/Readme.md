#Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

<b>What is OCP?</b>
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

This means that we should be able to add new functionality without modifying existing code. Instead of changing existing classes, we should extend them using abstraction, interfaces, or inheritance.
