# SolidPrinciple
<b>What is SOLID?</b></br>
SOLID is an acronym representing five fundamental principles of object-oriented software design. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) to help developers create software that is scalable, maintainable, and robust.
</br>

<b>Why Should You Use SOLID?</b></br>
Applying SOLID principles in C# and .NET development leads to:</br>
<b>Better Maintainability</b> – Code is easier to understand and modify.</br>
<b>Improved Scalability</b> – Adding new features without modifying existing code.</br>
<b>Reduced Bugs</b> – Clearer separation of concerns reduces unintended side effects.</br>
<b>Easier Testing</b> – Code is more modular, allowing for effective unit testing.</br>

<b>Breaking Down SOLID</b></br>
Each principle focuses on a key aspect of software design:</br>

<b>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</b> – A class should have only one reason to change.</br>
<b>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</b> – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.</br>
<b>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</b> – Subtypes must be replaceable without breaking functionality.</br>
<b>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</b> – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.</br>
<b>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</b> – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.</br>
