# SolidPrinciple
<b>What is SOLID?</b>
SOLID is an acronym representing five fundamental principles of object-oriented software design. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) to help developers create software that is scalable, maintainable, and robust.
</br>
<b>Why Should You Use SOLID?<b></br>
Applying SOLID principles in C# and .NET development leads to:</br>

Better Maintainability – Code is easier to understand and modify.</br>
Improved Scalability – Adding new features without modifying existing code.</br>
Reduced Bugs – Clearer separation of concerns reduces unintended side effects.</br>
Easier Testing – Code is more modular, allowing for effective unit testing.</br>
