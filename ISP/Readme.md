#Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

<b>What is the Interface Segregation Principle?</b>

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.This means that a class should not be required to implement methods it does not need. Instead of creating large, bloated interfaces, we should break them into smaller, more specific interfaces tailored to the needs of different clients.
