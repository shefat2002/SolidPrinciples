#Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

<b>What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?</b>
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

This means that a derived (child) class should be able to replace its base (parent) class without breaking functionality.

In simple terms: If class B is a subclass of class A, then objects of type A should be replaceable with objects of type B without unexpected behavior.
